Hello, World!
I'm Kaiokenky and I want to learn how to code. 
I have recently enrolled in CS50, as I wasn't sure where to start with coding.
My current goal is to develope a 2D platformer game.
Outside of my budding interest in coding I enjoy playing video games and training MMA (Jujitsu and Muay Thai)
